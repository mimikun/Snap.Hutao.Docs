Snap Hutao offers local achievement management feature, users can view and manage status of achievement

- At first time use, you will follow the instruction to create an archive and name it
- After that, you are still able to make new archives by click on `Create New Archive` for other game accounts

## Achievement Import

- Snap Hutao is using [Uniformed Interchangeable Achievement Format Standar](https://uigf.org/en/standards/UIAF.html) to store user's achievement data
  - This standard allows user to transmit achievement data between Snap Hutao wiht other achievement tools, such as **Achievement exporter**
- You can click on `Import` at top right menu on Achievement Management page, and select file import to load UIAF formatted data
