## Installing WebView2 Runtime

WebView2 Runtime is provided by Microsoft, which enables a built-in browser at a low resource cost inside the program.
As an optional component, WebView2 is not a mandatory component, but it will make some Snap Hutao's features easier.

At the bottom of the [Microsoft official page](https://developer.microsoft.com/zh-cn/microsoft-edge/webview2/),
you can find`Evergreen Standalone Installer`, choose`x64`download and install as prompted

[^first]:
    As LTSC and LTSB Windows versions do not contain Microsoft Store and some other necessary dependencies, they
    are not supported.Windows 10 Build 19041 is allowed to install Snap Hutao, but some features have known issues caused by
    Windows Os Kernal, those issues won't be fixed.
